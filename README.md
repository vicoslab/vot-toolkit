The VOT evaluation kit (legacy)
===============================

This repository contains the **legacy version** of the evaluation toolkit for the [Visual Object Tracking (VOT) challenge](http://votchallenge.net/). The toolkit is a set of Matlab (Octave compatible) scripts, a documentation and a set of integration examples for different programming languages. A new toolkit, written in Python 3 is avalable [here](https://github.com/votchallenge/toolkit).

For more detailed informations consult the documentation available in the source or a compiled version of the documentation [here](http://www.votchallenge.net/howto/).
